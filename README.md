2-5 Milestone: Design Doc

I chose this photo of an Apple Macintosh. Luckily there are many pictures of this computer at all kinds of different angles, so I will have plenty of reference material from all sides. 
Technically it only really has 3 objects, but the keyboard and monitor are complicated enough that it will be quite a few different primitive objects, that I hope it will be acceptable. 
The monitor body is made up of several cubes. From this picture you can tell it isn’t a perfect cube, so it will need to be broken down into at least one cube as the left face, one on the front, and one on the right. 
The front of the monitor will be a little tricky to mimic the indent. I think a prism, with a plane inside of it to be the screen. Several cubes put together and scaled will be a good fit for the slot. The keyboard has a ton of keys, but these are all cubes, so it will be tedious, but doable. 
The mouse will also be an interesting challenge, as it’s an odd shape. A cube for the body, and a cylinder to make the top part of the mouse, and another smaller cylinder would make the clicker. The only thing I don’t know is the cord, as it’s pretty curly but it could be made up of a bunch of cylinders to make it look smooth.
